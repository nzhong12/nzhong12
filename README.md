# 👋 What's up!

I'm Nathan, a coder and researcher at Brown University.

Developing products with code is fun. But I think pairing code with math and data is more exciting. To me, math is the *why* and *how*, while code is the freedom to explore the *what*. Whether it's graph theory or classical music, math reveals its structure. And I can bring it to life with code - through recommandation systems or melodic symphonies.

I also love the challenge of academic contests. Crafting algorithms or formulas to solve real-world problems is always exciting, and I've joined amazing communities along the way.

Currently, I am:
- 🛡️ Interning at Raytheon as a software engineer
- 🧬 Exploring diffusion models in medical imaging research
