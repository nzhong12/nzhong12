# 👋 What's up!

I'm Nathan, a coder and researcher at Brown University.

Developing products is fun. But I think pairing programming with math and data is even more exciting. To me, math is the *why* and *how*, while code gives freedom to explore the *what*. Whether it's graph theory or classical music, math reveals underlying structure — and code brings it to life through GPS systems, innovative melodies, and more.

I also enjoy the challenge of academic contests. Crafting algorithms or formulas to solve real-world problems is always exciting, and I've joined an amazing community along the way.

Currently, I am:
- 🛡️ Interning at Raytheon as a software engineer  
- 🧬 Exploring diffusion models in medical imaging research
