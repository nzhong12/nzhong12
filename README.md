# ðŸ‘‹ What's up!

I'm Nathan, a developer and researcher at Brown University studying Applied Math, Computer Science, and Economics.

Iâ€™m drawn to the hidden patterns behind everything â€” from the structure of a piano sonata to the flow of political ideas. Numbers are everywhere, and I love using math and code to make sense of them â€” transforming raw data into insight, impact, or innovation. 

Currently, Iâ€™m interning at Raytheon as a software engineer, working on backend systems for secure data access. On the side, Iâ€™m researching diffusion models for anonymizing medical images â€” blending AI with privacy.

Thanks for stopping by! Feel free to reach out.
