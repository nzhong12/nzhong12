# ðŸ‘‹ What's up!

I'm Nathan, a coder and researcher at Brown University.

Numbers have always fascinated me â€” not just because of their elegant interactions, but for what they explain. Programming helps me understand numbers at a deeper level, going beyond mathematics to uncover why events happen, how systems behave, and how we can improve them.

I also love the challenge of coding contests. Typing up algorithms to solve real-world problems is always exciting, and I've met an amazing community of developers along the way.

Currently, I am:
- Interning at Raytheon as a software engineer
- Exploring diffusion models in medical imaging research
