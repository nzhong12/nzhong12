# 👋 What's up!

I'm Nathan, a coder and researcher at Brown University.

Developing products is fun. But I think pairing programming with math and data is even more exciting. To me, math is the *why* and *how*, while code gives freedom to explore the *what*. Whether it's graph theory or music theory, math reveals underlying structure — which I can code to life through pathfinding systems, melodic chorales, and more.

I also enjoy the challenge of academic contests. Crafting solutions to creative problems is always exciting, and I've joined an amazing community along the way.

I have:
- 🛡️ Interned at Raytheon to support EarthData services
- 🧬 Explored diffusion models in medical imaging, researched static analysis for open-source codebases

Thanks for stopping by! Feel free to reach out 😊
