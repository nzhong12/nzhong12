👋 What's up!

I'm Nathan, a sophomore at Brown University studying applied math, computer science, and economics.

Developing products with code is fun. But I think pairing programming with math and data is even more exciting. To me, math is the *why* and *how*, the motivation behind decisions, while code gives freedom to explore the *what*. 

I also enjoy academic contests. Crafting creative solutions is always exciting, and I've joined an amazing community along the way.

A bit more about me:
- Interned at <b>Raytheon</b> to develop EarthData services 🛡️ 
- Explored diffusion models in medical imaging and researched static analysis for codebases at <b>Johns Hopkins University</b> 🧬 
- Incoming swe intern at <b>Coinbase</b>, Institutional Product Group 🏦

Thanks for stopping by! Feel free to reach out 😊
