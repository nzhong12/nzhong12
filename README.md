I'm Nathan, a sophomore at Brown University studying applied math, computer science, and economics.

Developing products with code is fun. But I think pairing programming with math and data is even more exciting. To me, math is the *why* and *how*, while code gives freedom to explore the *what*. Whether it's graph theory or music theory, math reveals underlying structure — which I can code to life through pathfinding systems, stock clusters, melodic chorales, and more.

I also enjoy the challenge of academic contests. Crafting solutions to creative problems is always exciting, and I've joined an amazing community along the way.

A bit more about me:
- Interned at <b>Raytheon<b> to develop EarthData services 🛡️ 
- Explored diffusion models in medical imaging and researched static analysis for open-source codebases at <b>Johns Hopkins University<b> 🧬
